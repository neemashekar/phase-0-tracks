A VPS is a virtual machine you can create without needing the actual hardware present at your location. The physical hardware of the machine lies else where and you can access your virtual machine using the command line and the IP address of your machine or with other software meant for managing virtual machines. One of the advantages of using a VPS is that changes made on the VPS do not persist so if you accidentally get a virus on your machines, you can just restart the virtual machine and the virus will be gone.
