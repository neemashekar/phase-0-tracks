<!--

HTML5 semantic tags clearly describe their meanings to both the developer and the browser. The most useful ones i find are <form>, <table>, and <article>

The browser displays elements in the order presented from the html file ie top to bottom

I learned that you can create templates for commonly used tags and create events such as the tab trigger event to easily write out your commonly used tags

I just have never created XML templates before so seeing the code for these types of files was unfamiliar. Using templates more will help me improve with my understandings of these types of files.
