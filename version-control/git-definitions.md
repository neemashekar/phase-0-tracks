# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

MINOR CHANGE! 

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to keep track of files as they continuously undergo change by multiple programmers. It is userful because it becomes simple to roll back any changes if any problems arise with the code. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branches are copies of files that can later be merged together. Branches help isolate your work from others working on the same code. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
It records changes to the repository. A good message would detail briefly what the changes you made are. 

* What is a merge conflict?
These are errors that occur when merging or pulling from a branch.
